<h2>Saviors of Arengea</h2>
  <p>Arengea, a vast land of many peoples has enjoyed a century of peace. From the beautiful green hills to the peaks of Kalduran, all was well â€” or so it seemed.</p>
<div class="story">

    <p class="hidden">An assembly of heroes has begun at the great merchant city of Medial, named as such as sits in the center of all the land. A horn roars in the Grand Hall as the Archduke of Medial rises to greet the assembly.</p>
    <p class="hidden">"I have received a letter of distress from Minare. The Aquifer has grown afoul. Alas, I am afraid that this problem has not been caused by any natural phenomenon. Nay, many a report claims a growing number of spirits and not just nixies either, but terrible creatures that have not been seen for an age."</p>
    <p class="hidden">"I call upon you heroes. Journey to Minare and put these demons to rest. Set first for the inn <em>8 leagues to the South</em> and meet there with the Minaren envoy."</p>
    <p class="hidden">Exchanging pleasantries, the heroes become acquainted. After much discussion, they retire to the local inn at Medial and <em>rest</em> until morning.</p>
    <p class="hidden">By the next afternoon, the party had already marched nearly 8 leagues and neared the southern inn. "Help! Stay back, creature!" Just off the road, a disheveled man was being toyed with by a pack of lesser demons. <br>[<em>Draw 3 enemy cards and begin combat.</em>]</p>
